# Portfolio 🌐

Welcome to my personal portfolio! Built with **React.js**, this project showcases my skills, projects, and expertise in frontend development. Additionally, I've integrated **EmailJS** to enable seamless contact functionality.

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamic UI with **React.js**
- Email contact form powered by **EmailJS**
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop users
- Showcases my **projects, skills, and achievements**
- Smooth animations & interactive elements
- Optimized for fast performance and accessibility

## 🔧 Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Esakkiammal-G/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the portfolio on `localhost:3000`.

### 📌 Environment Variables

If EmailJS integration requires API keys or credentials, set up a `.env` file:

```sh
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id  
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id  
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_user_id  
```

Be sure to add `.env` to `.gitignore`.
