# My Portfolio 🌐

Welcome to my personal portfolio! Built with **React.js**, this project showcases my skills, projects, and expertise in frontend development. Additionally, I've integrated **EmailJS** to enable seamless contact functionality.

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamic UI with **React.js**
- Email contact form powered by **EmailJS**
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop users
- Showcases my **projects, skills, and achievements**
- Smooth animations & interactive elements
- Optimized for fast performance and accessibility

## 🔧 Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the portfolio on `localhost:3000`.

### 📌 Environment Variables

If EmailJS integration requires API keys or credentials, set up a `.env` file:

```sh
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_user_id
```

Ensure that this file is **not** committed to GitHub by adding `.env` to `.gitignore`.

## 🚀 Deployment

You can deploy the portfolio using:
- **GitHub Pages**
- **Vercel**
- **Netlify**

To deploy on Netlify, follow these steps:

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
2. **Sign in to Netlify and select "New site from GitHub"**
3. **Choose your repository and configure build settings**
4. **Deploy and access the live site!** 🎉

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Fixes
1. **EmailJS not working?**  
   - Ensure your environment variables are correctly set.
   - Check for API key expiration.

2. **Deployment errors?**  
   - Try clearing the cache (`npm cache clean --force`).
   - Check build settings for Netlify or Vercel.
